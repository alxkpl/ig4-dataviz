However, they have been postponed on several occasions. The new President of the Republic had not been elected before outgoing President Michel Martelly left office on 7 February 2016. The run-off presidential and parliamentary elections have been scheduled for 24 April. - On 14 February, the National Assembly (a joint session of both chambers of parliament) elected Senate President Privert as interim President. He subsequently resigned as a senator in order to assume the new post. - As at 15 February 2016, there were seven vacant seats: six undecided seats from the 2015 elections and one seat vacated by the former President of the Senate."
